| _netflix-practice.md_ | Queries that perform the requested operations correctly: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7<br><br>However, the writeup for Query 6 is a tad out of sync: the natural language states an average ≥ 4, the screenshot asks for an average > 4, and the query text is for an average > 3. Um which is it 😅 (–1)<br><br>Some nice continuity across queries 🐕🦮🐩🐕‍🦺 | 27/28 |

| • Link to dataset | Link to dataset was provided | 1/1 |
| • Description of dataset | Dataset is described well alongside possible applications that would use it; sample queries make sense for the domain. Overall good detail and clear organization | 4/4 |
| _.gitignore_ | _.gitignore_ contains appropriate ignores |  |
| _schema.pdf_ | Schema diagram effectively communicates the intended design of the database, with proper notation of referring keys. Primary keys are less clearly indicated; although they can be inferred, it would have been safest to follow the notation that was given (–1)<br><br>Although the referring-key notation is correct, some arrows are in the wrong direction. Remember anything that _references_ something has the arrow pointing toward what is being references. This isn’t always correctly done in the diagram (–1)<br><br>Not a super huge deal, but the naming convention for tables representing many-to-many relationships typically separates the referenced tables with an underscore (e.g., _movie_genre_, _movie_keyword_) | 3/5 |
| _schema.sql_ | Schema SQL appears to follow the design and executes without errors | 5/5 |
